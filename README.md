# Lab's Purpose

The process of configuring, optimizing and securing an I.T. infrastructure.

This is all virtual but the knowledge gained is scalable to enterprise level.

It provides a safe environment to train, study and learn. It has components and tools that work in a similar fashion to large scale infrastructures.

The beauty of this lab setup is it can be backed up, snapshots and copied to other sytems.
